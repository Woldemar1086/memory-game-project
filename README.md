# Memory game

Hi for everyone.

This is my project for Udacity Frontend Web develope Nanodegree Programm.

## How to play a game.

To win, you should find for every card a twin. The another card with the same image.

So, when you open the first card the game starts.

**You have a 3 minutes to win.**

If you open all cards for 40 or less steps, you have a realy cool memory.
